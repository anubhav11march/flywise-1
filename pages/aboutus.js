          only after going through similar struggles when he shifted to the USA
          to do his MS. Pavan is also someone who comes from a middle-class
          family in India. He is a young and dynamic person who wants to bring
          change in aspiring studentsâ€™ lives by providing them real life
          experienced support at FLYWISE. He struggled so much and then achieved
          everything with flying colors. Pavan has broken all the stereotypes of
          studying abroad. He came to the USA and switched his major from
          mechanical to DATA SCIENCE got into a good University with budget
          friendly fees. He worked hard and grabbed the opportunity by getting
          his first job at AMAZON even before graduating. He paid off his study
          load with his first salary and bonus. Now, he is helping to nurture
          aspiring students with dreams of getting settled abroad. He is making
          full use of his own experience at FLYWISE by making another {`Pavan's`}
          dream real.
